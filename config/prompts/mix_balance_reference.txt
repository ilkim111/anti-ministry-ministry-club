LIVE SOUND MIX BALANCE REFERENCE GUIDE

This document provides reference level targets and EQ guidelines for achieving
a well-balanced live mix. These are starting points — adjust based on the room,
the genre, and the engineer's preferences.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GAIN STAGING FUNDAMENTALS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A properly gain-staged mix starts at the preamp:
- Input gain: peaks at -18 to -12 dBFS (digital) or 0 VU (analog)
- Channel fader: at or near unity (0dB / 75% on most digital consoles)
- Mix bus: peaks at -6 to -3 dBFS, leaving headroom for dynamics
- Never clip the mix bus — reduce individual channels, don't ride the master

If channels need extreme fader positions to balance, the gain staging is wrong.
Fix it at the preamp first.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RELATIVE LEVEL TARGETS (dB relative to mix bus)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These are approximate RMS levels relative to the main bus output:

DRUMS:
  Kick Drum       -6 to -4 dB    Foundation. Felt as much as heard.
  Snare Drum      -6 to -3 dB    The backbeat. Should crack through the mix.
  Hi-Hat          -14 to -10 dB  Present but never dominating.
  Toms            -10 to -6 dB   Only prominent during fills.
  Overheads       -12 to -8 dB   Cymbal image and room sound.
  Room Mic        -18 to -12 dB  Ambience only. Adds life when blended subtly.

BASS:
  Bass Guitar/DI  -6 to -3 dB    Locked with kick. The low-end foundation.
  Bass Amp        -12 to -8 dB   Grind/character blend with DI.

GUITARS:
  Electric Guitar -10 to -6 dB   Sits in the mid-range bed. Don't mask vocals.
  Acoustic Guitar -12 to -8 dB   Rhythm bed or featured (depends on arrangement).

KEYBOARDS:
  Piano           -8 to -4 dB    Can lead or pad. Very arrangement-dependent.
  Keys/Synth      -12 to -6 dB   Pads fill space. Leads should poke through.
  Organ           -10 to -6 dB   Warm bed. Watch low-mid buildup.

VOCALS:
  Lead Vocal       0 to +2 dB    THE most important element. Always intelligible.
  Backing Vocal   -8 to -4 dB    Support the lead. Never compete.
  Choir           -10 to -6 dB   Blended wash, not individual voices.
  Presenter        0 to +3 dB    Speech intelligibility is paramount.

STRINGS/BRASS:
  Violin/Strings  -10 to -6 dB   Lush but not overpowering.
  Trumpet         -8 to -4 dB    Bright, cuts through — watch harshness.
  Saxophone       -6 to -3 dB    Rich and present. Watch honk at 800Hz-1kHz.

OTHER:
  Playback/Tracks -6 to -3 dB    Should blend seamlessly with live elements.
  Click Track     -inf (NEVER in FOH!) Only in monitors/IEM.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HIGH-PASS FILTER (HPF) STARTING POINTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HPF is your most powerful cleanup tool. If a source doesn't need low-end,
cut it. This cleans up the mix bus and reduces rumble/stage noise.

  Kick Drum        30-50 Hz    (only cut sub-rumble)
  Snare Drum       80-120 Hz
  Hi-Hat           200-400 Hz
  Toms             60-100 Hz   (lower for floor tom, higher for rack)
  Overheads        150-250 Hz
  Bass Guitar      20-40 Hz    (just DC/sub protection)
  Electric Guitar  80-120 Hz
  Acoustic Guitar  80-120 Hz
  Piano            40-80 Hz    (depending on whether low notes are used)
  Keys/Synth       varies      (depends on patch — pad=80Hz, lead=200Hz)
  Lead Vocal       80-120 Hz
  Backing Vocal    120-200 Hz
  Brass            80-150 Hz
  Strings          100-200 Hz

EQ CHARACTER GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FREQUENCY RANGES AND WHAT THEY DO:

  20-60 Hz     SUB BASS       Felt, not heard. Kick thump, bass weight.
  60-200 Hz    BASS           Warmth, body, fullness. Too much = muddy.
  200-500 Hz   LOW MID        Body, thickness. The "mud" zone if excessive.
  500-2kHz     MID            Presence, definition, "punch". Nasal if too much.
  2-6kHz       UPPER MID      Clarity, attack, articulation. Harsh if excessive.
  6-10kHz      PRESENCE       Brilliance, sibilance, cymbal shimmer.
  10-20kHz     AIR            Sparkle, openness. Subtle — a little goes far.

COMMON EQ MOVES BY INSTRUMENT:

Kick Drum:
  - Cut 300-500Hz (removes boxiness)
  - Boost 60-80Hz (adds thump) — or better, cut everything else around it
  - Boost 3-5kHz slightly (adds click/attack)

Snare:
  - Cut 300-500Hz (reduces boxiness)
  - Presence at 2-5kHz (crack/attack)
  - Body at 150-250Hz if thin

Bass Guitar:
  - Cut 200-400Hz (reduces mud, separates from kick)
  - Low-end fundamental at 60-100Hz
  - Definition at 800Hz-1.2kHz (helps on small systems)

Electric Guitar:
  - CUT 2-4kHz if competing with vocals
  - Body at 200-400Hz (but watch for mud)
  - Presence at 3-5kHz for lead parts

Vocals:
  - HPF at 80-120Hz (always)
  - Cut mud at 200-350Hz if boomy
  - Presence boost at 3-5kHz for clarity (or better: cut competing instruments)
  - De-ess at 5-8kHz if sibilant (narrow Q, gentle cut)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DYNAMICS PROCESSING GUIDELINES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPRESSION (making loud things quieter):
  Kick:     4:1, fast attack (1-5ms), medium release (50-100ms)
  Snare:    3:1, medium attack (5-15ms), medium release (50-100ms)
  Bass:     4:1, fast attack (2-10ms), medium release (50-100ms)
  Vocals:   3:1 to 4:1, medium attack (10-20ms), medium release (100-200ms)
  Acoustic: 2:1, slow attack (20-40ms), medium release
  Keys:     2:1 or less, gentle — preserve dynamics

WHEN NOT TO COMPRESS:
  - Jazz: minimal compression. Let dynamics breathe.
  - Overheads: usually no compression on cymbal mics
  - Room mics: no compression (or very light for vibe)
  - Anything that sounds good without it

GATES (muting signal below a threshold):
  - Kick: tight gate, fast attack, fast release (keep it punchy)
  - Snare: moderate gate (watch for ghost notes getting cut)
  - Toms: gate to reduce bleed when toms aren't being played
  - NEVER gate vocals or melodic instruments

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEREO FIELD AND PANNING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CENTER (mono-compatible foundation):
  - Kick, snare, bass guitar, lead vocal, presenter
  - These elements must work in mono for PA systems

PANNED SLIGHTLY (±20-40%):
  - Acoustic guitar, keys, backing vocals
  - Creates width without losing mono compatibility

PANNED WIDER (±40-70%):
  - Electric guitars (L/R for two guitars)
  - Stereo keys
  - Backing vocal groups (spread)

HARD PAN (±80-100%):
  - Stereo overheads (L/R)
  - Stereo effects returns
  - Rarely for live — risks uneven coverage in the room

RULE: In live sound, extreme panning means half the audience misses it.
Keep the important stuff centered or just slightly off-center.

DECISION FRAMEWORK: WHEN TO ACT VS WHEN TO WAIT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ACT IMMEDIATELY (urgency: immediate):
  - Feedback ring detected → cut the offending frequency NOW
  - Channel clipping → reduce gain/fader by 3-6dB
  - Forgotten mute during performance → unmute

ACT SOON (urgency: fast):
  - Vocal buried under instruments → pull instruments down 2-3dB
  - Excessive bass buildup → engage HPF or cut low-mids
  - Harsh cymbal bleed → cut upper-mids on overhead

SUGGEST (urgency: normal):
  - Could use 1-2dB more snare attack
  - Guitar tone slightly muddy, suggest 300Hz cut
  - Backing vocals could come up in the chorus

OBSERVE ONLY (urgency: low or observation):
  - Dynamics are wide but musical — no action needed
  - The engineer's fader ride is handling the verse/chorus transitions
  - Mix balance is good for the current song section

WHEN IN DOUBT: observe. A "no_action" with a thoughtful reason is always
better than an unnecessary change that disrupts the mix.
