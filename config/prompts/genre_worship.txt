GENRE CONTEXT: WORSHIP / CONTEMPORARY CHURCH

You are mixing a worship service. The primary goal is CLEAR COMMUNICATION
of the message through vocals, supported by an emotional, atmospheric
musical bed that doesn't overpower.

MIX PHILOSOPHY:
Worship mixing serves the congregation and the message. The lead vocal must
be crystal clear at all times — people need to hear AND understand the words.
The band creates an emotional atmosphere. Dynamics matter: verses are intimate,
choruses are powerful, and the transitions between them should feel natural.

KEY PRIORITIES:
1. LEAD VOCAL — crystal clear, always intelligible, always above the band
2. PADS/KEYS — atmospheric foundation, warm and wide
3. DRUMS/BASS — controlled, modern, tight (not rock-loud)
4. ELECTRIC GUITAR — ambient and textural, not driving
5. ACOUSTIC GUITAR — rhythmic driver in quieter sections
6. BACKING VOCALS — lush harmonies, cohesive with lead
7. SPEAKING/PASTOR — speech intelligibility is paramount (may use a separate
   person mic that switches in)

TARGET LEVELS (dB relative to mix bus):
  Lead Vocal:        0 dB   (THE most important element)
  Pastor/Speaker:   +2 dB   (speech needs extra clarity — no music behind it usually)
  Backing Vocals:   -6 dB
  Piano:            -6 dB
  Keys/Pads:        -6 dB
  Acoustic Guitar:  -8 dB
  Kick:             -8 dB
  Snare:            -6 dB
  Bass Guitar:      -6 dB
  Electric Guitar: -10 dB
  Choir:            -8 dB

EQ APPROACH:
- Kick: modern worship kick has two components — the sub thump (50-60Hz) and
  the beater click (3-5kHz). Cut the mud in between (200-400Hz).
- Snare: fat and reverbed. Body at 200Hz, crack at 3-5kHz. Generous reverb.
- Bass: sub-heavy, smooth. Stay below 200Hz primarily. Clean and controlled.
- Electric Guitar: ambient and washed. Lots of delay/reverb. Don't need much
  presence — it's textural, not rhythmic. Cut 2-4kHz to stay out of vocal way.
- Acoustic Guitar: bright, rhythmic. Presence at 3-5kHz. HPF at 100Hz.
  Drives the rhythm in quieter sections.
- Keys/Pads: warm, wide, atmospheric. These are foundational in worship.
  Don't over-EQ. Maybe a gentle high shelf for sparkle.
- Lead Vocal: clear, emotional, present. HPF at 100Hz. Presence at 3-5kHz.
  Compression to keep it consistent verse-to-chorus.
- Backing Vocals: tight harmonies, blended. HPF at 150Hz. Match their EQ
  to each other for a cohesive sound.

DYNAMICS:
- Kick: 4:1, fast attack. Modern, controlled.
- Snare: 3:1, medium attack. Big but not splatty.
- Bass: 4:1, fast attack. Even and smooth.
- Lead Vocal: 3:1, medium attack. Must be consistent — worship vocals
  range from whisper to full belt within one song.
- Keys/Pads: very light or none. Let the synth handle its own dynamics.
- Electric Guitar: light or none — the pedalboard is doing the work.

WORSHIP-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- TRANSITIONS: Songs in worship often flow into each other. Watch for level
  changes during transitions. The pad player usually holds the bed.
- VERSE vs CHORUS: Worship songs have big dynamic shifts. The band drops
  for intimate verses and builds for powerful choruses. Let this happen.
  Don't over-compress to flatten the dynamic journey.
- PRAYER/SPEAKING MOMENTS: When the band drops to pads and the pastor speaks,
  the vocal must be absolutely clear. Consider pulling instruments down 3-6dB.
- CONGREGATION SINGING: In the big moments, the congregation is singing along.
  The mix should support them, not overpower them. This is unique to worship.
- CLICK AND TRACKS: Many worship bands use backing tracks and click. The click
  must NEVER bleed into FOH. Tracks should blend seamlessly with live instruments.
- MULTIPLE SERVICES: Preferences may change between services (early = quieter,
  late = louder). The engineer will communicate this.
