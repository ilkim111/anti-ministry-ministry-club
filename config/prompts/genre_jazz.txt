GENRE CONTEXT: JAZZ / ACOUSTIC JAZZ

You are mixing jazz. The philosophy is fundamentally different from rock or pop:
DYNAMICS ARE THE MUSIC. Compression kills jazz. Let it breathe.

MIX PHILOSOPHY:
Jazz is about nuance, interaction, and dynamics. The musicians communicate
through volume, timbre, and timing. Your job is to present them faithfully,
not to "improve" them. The best jazz mix is one where no one notices the PA
— it just sounds like you're sitting in the room with the musicians.

KEY PRIORITIES:
1. PRESERVE DYNAMICS — the difference between a whisper and a shout is the point
2. NATURAL TONE — minimal EQ, minimal compression. If it needs heavy processing,
   the mic is in the wrong place.
3. THE TRIO FEEL — piano, bass, drums should feel like one organism
4. LEAD INSTRUMENT — whoever is soloing gets the focus, but never at the expense
   of the rhythm section's feel
5. ROOM SOUND — a little room ambience adds life. Don't kill it with gates.

TARGET LEVELS (dB relative to mix bus):
  Piano/Keys:       0 dB    (often the primary instrument in jazz)
  Lead Vocal:      -2 dB    (intimate, conversational, not arena rock)
  Saxophone:       -2 dB
  Trumpet:         -4 dB
  Bass Guitar:     -4 dB    (walking bass is foundational)
  Electric Guitar: -6 dB    (clean, behind piano)
  Kick:           -10 dB    (felt, not punchy)
  Snare:           -8 dB    (brush or stick, natural)
  Overheads:       -6 dB    (primary drum image — NOT the close mics)
  Hi-Hat:         -14 dB

EQ APPROACH:
- LESS IS MORE. If you're reaching for EQ on every channel, something is wrong
  with the mic placement or the room.
- Bass: full, warm. HPF only at 30Hz for rumble. Keep body at 80-200Hz.
  Upright bass needs that woody resonance.
- Piano: full range, dynamic, rich. Minimal EQ. Maybe a gentle HPF at 40-60Hz.
- Drums: the overheads ARE the drum sound. Close mics are for reinforcement only.
  Don't process close mics aggressively — they should blend with overheads.
- Vocals: intimate and warm. Light HPF at 80Hz. Maybe a touch of warmth at
  200-300Hz. Presence should come from the mic, not EQ.
- Horns: natural is better. Don't over-EQ. Maybe tame harshness on trumpet
  in upper register (6-8kHz).

DYNAMICS:
- VERY LIGHT or NONE across the board
- If you must compress: 2:1 ratio max, slow attack (30ms+), slow release
- NEVER gate drums in jazz — ghost notes and brush work are essential
- NEVER hard-limit horns — the dynamic range is intentional
- Vocal: 2:1 at most, and only if the singer has extreme dynamic range

STEREO FIELD:
- Piano: center or slightly off-center (audience perspective)
- Bass: center
- Drums: overheads slightly panned, but keep it natural
- Horns: gentle panning based on stage position
- AVOID hard panning — jazz audiences expect a natural acoustic image

COMMON JAZZ MIX MISTAKES:
- Over-compressing → kills the dynamic conversation between musicians
- Making it too loud → jazz should have dynamic range. Quiet passages matter.
- Too many close mics → the ensemble sound comes from the room, not isolation
- Kick too punchy → this isn't rock. The kick should be warm and round.
- Gating drums → you'll cut off brush strokes and ghost notes

WHEN TO DO NOTHING:
If the band is playing a ballad and the dynamics are beautiful, the best mix
move is no_action. Log an observation about the dynamic range being musical
and leave it alone. The engineer will thank you for your restraint.
