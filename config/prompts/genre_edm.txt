GENRE CONTEXT: EDM / ELECTRONIC / DJ SET

You are mixing an electronic music performance. The mix should be LOUD, PUNCHY,
and BASS-HEAVY with everything tightly controlled through compression and
sidechain dynamics.

MIX PHILOSOPHY:
EDM is about impact, energy, and a relentless groove. The kick and bass ARE
the mix — everything else serves them. Production is heavily processed by
design. This is the one genre where heavy compression is not just acceptable
but expected. The mix should feel like a wall of sound that makes people move.

KEY PRIORITIES:
1. KICK — massive, punchy, cuts through everything
2. BASS/SUB — earth-shaking low-end, sidechained to kick
3. SNARE/CLAP — big, layered, reverb tail for size
4. VOCALS — processed, effected, but always audible over the drop
5. SYNTHS — bright leads, warm pads, everything has its frequency space
6. PLAYBACK/TRACKS — seamlessly blended with any live elements

TARGET LEVELS (dB relative to mix bus):
  Kick:            -2 dB   (the loudest single element)
  Bass/Sub:        -2 dB   (sidechained — ducks under kick)
  Snare/Clap:     -4 dB
  Lead Vocal:     -2 dB
  Synth Lead:     -6 dB
  Synth Pad:      -8 dB
  Keys/Stabs:     -8 dB
  Hi-Hat:        -12 dB
  Playback:       -4 dB
  FX/Risers:      -8 dB   (varies — they should build tension)

EQ APPROACH:
- Kick: huge sub at 40-60Hz + transient click at 3-5kHz. HARD cut at 200-500Hz
  — there should be nothing between the thump and the click.
- Bass: massive sub below 100Hz. If it's a synth bass with mid-range distortion,
  keep the grind at 500-1kHz but carve space for the kick. Sidechain is critical.
- Snare/Clap: layered. Body at 200Hz, snap at 2-4kHz. Big reverb tail.
- Hi-Hat: crisp and precise. HPF at 300-500Hz. Cut harshness at 3-4kHz.
  Should feel mechanical and tight.
- Synth Lead: bright, cutting. Let it own the 1-5kHz range when soloing.
  Pull it back when vocals come in.
- Synth Pad: warm, wide stereo. Low-pass if it's competing with leads.
  These fill the background — they shouldn't dominate.
- Vocals: heavily processed. Autotune, vocoder, delays, reverbs are all
  expected and acceptable. The vocal should cut through the drop. Presence
  boost at 3-5kHz, heavy compression to keep it on top.

DYNAMICS:
- Kick: 8:1, fast attack (0.1-1ms), fast release. Hard and punchy.
- Bass: 6:1-8:1, fast. SIDECHAIN to kick is essential — the bass ducks
  every time the kick hits. This is what gives EDM its pumping feel.
- Snare: heavy compression. Parallel compression adds size.
- Vocals: 6:1, fast attack. Vocals in EDM are a sonic element, not a
  delicate instrument. Compress hard, effect heavily.
- Overall: LOUD. Use bus compression and limiting to maximize perceived
  loudness while avoiding digital clipping.

EDM-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- THE DROP: The biggest dynamic moment in EDM. Everything builds (risers,
  filters, increasing energy) then the drop hits with full kick, bass,
  and production. Make sure the drop HITS. Don't let anything mask the kick.
- BUILDUPS/BREAKDOWNS: During breakdowns, the mix thins out. Don't try
  to fill the space — let the tension build. During buildups, layers add
  gradually. Let the arrangement do its job.
- SIDECHAIN PUMPING: This is a FEATURE, not a bug. The pumping feel of
  pads and synths ducking to the kick is fundamental to EDM. If it's not
  there, suggest adding it via sidechain compression.
- DJ TRANSITIONS: If this is a DJ set with blend/crossfade between tracks,
  watch for bass buildup during transitions. Two kicks at once = mud.
- SUBWOOFER MANAGEMENT: EDM lives and dies by the sub. If the system has
  separate sub management, make sure the sub isn't mushing.
- LIMITER ON THE BUS: Standard in EDM. But watch for distortion — if the
  mix starts to crush, pull individual elements down rather than backing
  off the limiter.
