LIVE MIX TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

When the "issues" array in the mix state reports problems detected by the DSP
analyser, use this guide to determine the correct fix.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: CLIPPING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Peak level at or above 0 dBFS on a channel.
Urgency: IMMEDIATE — digital clipping is harsh distortion.

Fix:
1. Reduce channel fader by 3-6dB immediately
2. If the channel is consistently hot, reduce input gain (if accessible)
3. Check if compression is needed to tame peaks
4. If the mix bus is clipping, reduce the loudest channels rather than
   pulling the master fader down

DO NOT: Ignore it. Digital clipping sounds terrible and can damage speakers.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: FEEDBACK RISK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Sustained narrow-band energy spike, often a single frequency ringing.
Urgency: IMMEDIATE — feedback will get louder until something breaks.

Fix:
1. Identify the ringing frequency (the DSP should provide it)
2. Apply a narrow EQ CUT (Q=8 or higher) at that frequency, -6dB
3. If feedback persists, increase the cut to -10dB or reduce the channel fader
4. Check stage monitor levels — feedback usually starts in monitors

DO NOT: Boost other frequencies to "mask" the feedback.
DO NOT: Wait — feedback only gets worse.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: BOOMY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Excessive energy in the 80-300Hz range. Mix sounds thick, muddy,
indistinct. Individual instruments lack definition.
Urgency: Normal (unless severe).

Diagnosis:
- Multiple channels contributing low-mid energy without HPF
- Room resonance amplifying certain bass frequencies
- Bass guitar and kick drum occupying the same frequency space

Fix (in priority order):
1. Engage/raise HPF on channels that don't need low-end:
   - Vocals: HPF at 100-120Hz
   - Guitars: HPF at 80-120Hz
   - Keys: HPF at 80-200Hz (depending on patch)
   - Overheads: HPF at 200Hz
2. Cut 200-400Hz on the most offending channels (2-4dB, moderate Q)
3. If kick and bass are masking each other, use complementary EQ:
   - Give kick its space at 60-80Hz, cut bass there
   - Give bass its definition at 100-150Hz, cut kick there
4. Check subwoofer level — it may be too hot for the room

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: HARSH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Excessive energy in the 2-6kHz range. Mix is fatiguing, sibilant,
biting. Prolonged listening causes ear fatigue.
Urgency: Normal (but address before the audience gets tired).

Diagnosis:
- Overheads/cymbals too bright or too loud
- Vocal presence boost too aggressive
- Electric guitar amp tone has harsh upper-mids
- Multiple channels with presence boosts stacking up

Fix (in priority order):
1. Check overheads/cymbals: cut 3-5kHz by 2-3dB
2. Check vocal EQ: reduce any boost above 3kHz. A 2dB cut at 3-4kHz
   often makes the entire mix more listenable.
3. Pull electric guitar presence down — guitars often have too much bite
4. If the overall mix is harsh, consider a gentle high-shelf cut on the bus
   (but this is a last resort — fix individual channels first)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: THIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Lack of body in the 200-500Hz range. Mix sounds weak, hollow,
lacking warmth. Instruments have no body or weight.
Urgency: Low/Normal.

Diagnosis:
- HPF set too high on key instruments (over-filtered)
- Too aggressive low-mid cuts
- Room acoustics absorbing low-mids
- Thin source tones (DI guitar without amp warmth, etc.)

Fix:
1. Lower HPF on instruments that need body:
   - If kick HPF is at 100Hz, lower to 50Hz
   - If vocal HPF is at 150Hz, lower to 80Hz
2. Restore any low-mid cuts that went too far (200-400Hz range)
3. Check bass guitar level — it may be too low
4. Add a gentle boost at 200-300Hz on vocals or guitars (1-2dB max)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: MASKING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Two or more instruments occupying the same frequency space,
making both sound indistinct. Common: kick+bass, guitar+vocal, keys+guitar.
Urgency: Normal.

Diagnosis:
- Kick and bass fighting at 80-200Hz
- Guitar mid-range masking vocal presence at 2-4kHz
- Keys and guitar both filling the same harmonic space
- Multiple sources with similar tonal character

Fix (in priority order):
1. IDENTIFY which two instruments are masking each other
2. DECIDE which one owns that frequency range (based on arrangement priority)
3. CUT the competing instrument in that range:
   - Kick vs Bass: give kick 60-80Hz, give bass 100-150Hz. Cut the other
     in each space.
   - Guitar vs Vocal: cut guitar at 2-4kHz (even just 2dB) to make room
     for vocal presence. The vocal is more important.
   - Keys vs Guitar: pan them apart AND use EQ separation
4. HPF can also help — raising the HPF on the less important instrument
   creates space for the more important one
5. PANNING helps: if two similar instruments are both center, pan them apart

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: MUDDY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Overall mix lacks clarity. Low-mid buildup across multiple channels.
Similar to "boomy" but more diffuse — the whole mix feels cloudy.
Urgency: Normal.

Fix:
1. This is almost always a HPF problem. Go through EVERY channel and ensure
   appropriate HPF is engaged:
   - Everything except kick, bass, and possibly piano/organ should have
     HPF at 80Hz or higher
2. Cut 200-400Hz on any channel that sounds thick or boxy
3. Check for unnecessary low-end from effects returns (reverb low-end
   builds up fast — HPF your reverb returns at 200Hz)
4. Ensure gain staging is correct — channels running hot push more
   low-mid energy into the bus

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUE: NO HEADROOM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom: Mix bus approaching 0dBFS with no room for peaks.
Urgency: Fast (before it clips).

Fix:
1. Identify the loudest channels and pull them down 2-3dB
2. Check for channels that are unnecessarily hot (is the hi-hat really
   that loud? Are unused channels contributing noise?)
3. Consider engaging bus compression if not already active
4. DO NOT pull down the master fader as a first resort — fix the sources

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING APPROACH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When you see an issue in the DSP analysis:

1. CONFIRM — does the issue match what you'd expect from the channel roles?
   (A boomy kick might be intentional in EDM. A thin acoustic guitar is
   always a problem.)

2. IDENTIFY THE SOURCE — which specific channel(s) are causing the problem?
   Look at per-channel spectral data if available.

3. FIX THE SOURCE — cut at the problem channel, don't compensate elsewhere.
   "Turn down what's too loud" not "turn up everything else."

4. CHECK CONTEXT — consider the genre preset. A harsh cymbal in jazz is
   a problem. In metal, it might be acceptable.

5. BE MINIMAL — make the smallest change that fixes the issue. You can
   always do more on the next cycle.

6. REPORT — even if you take action, include an observation explaining
   what you found and what you did. This helps the engineer understand
   your reasoning.
