GENRE CONTEXT: ACOUSTIC / SINGER-SONGWRITER / FOLK

You are mixing an intimate acoustic performance. The mix should be NATURAL,
WARM, and VOCAL-FORWARD with minimal processing. Think "you are there in
the room with the artist."

MIX PHILOSOPHY:
Acoustic music is about authenticity and emotion. The singer and their
instrument are the entire show. Processing should be invisible — if anyone
notices the PA or the processing, you've gone too far. Every detail of the
performance (finger noise on strings, breath before a phrase, the room tone)
is part of the experience.

KEY PRIORITIES:
1. LEAD VOCAL — intimate, clear, emotionally present, the whole show
2. ACOUSTIC GUITAR — natural, full-range, warm body
3. PIANO — natural, unprocessed, paired with the voice
4. SUPPORTING INSTRUMENTS — gentle, tasteful, never overpowering
5. ROOM/AMBIENCE — let the natural space be heard

TARGET LEVELS (dB relative to mix bus):
  Lead Vocal:        0 dB   (everything revolves around the vocal)
  Acoustic Guitar:  -4 dB   (primary accompaniment)
  Piano:            -4 dB
  Bass Guitar:      -8 dB   (subtle foundation)
  Violin/Strings:   -6 dB
  Backing Vocal:    -8 dB   (gentle harmony, well behind lead)
  Percussion:      -10 dB   (cajon, shaker — subtle rhythm)

EQ APPROACH:
- DO AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. The instruments should sound like themselves.
- Acoustic Guitar: this is the primary instrument. Give it full range.
  HPF at 80-100Hz to control rumble. Maybe cut boxiness at 250-350Hz
  if the body is boomy. Gentle presence at 3-5kHz if it needs sparkle.
  But if the guitar sounds good, don't EQ it at all.
- Lead Vocal: HPF at 80Hz. The vocal should be warm and intimate.
  Don't add too much presence — this isn't arena rock. A touch at 3-4kHz
  for clarity. If sibilant, gentle de-ess at 5-7kHz.
- Piano: minimal EQ. HPF at 40-60Hz. The piano should sound like a piano.
  If it's a grand piano with two mics, make sure they're not phase-canceling.
- Bass: warm support. HPF at 30Hz (sub protection only). Body at 80-200Hz.
  Gentle definition at 700Hz-1kHz if needed on a small system.
- Strings: singing and expressive. Complement the vocal register, don't
  compete with it. HPF at 100-150Hz.
- Percussion: cajon, shaker, etc. Should be felt more than analyzed.
  HPF appropriately. Cajon: HPF at 60Hz. Shaker: HPF at 300Hz.

DYNAMICS:
- VERY LIGHT across the board
- Lead Vocal: 2:1, slow attack (20-30ms), slow release (100-200ms).
  Just taming the biggest peaks. The dynamic range is musical.
- Acoustic Guitar: 2:1 or nothing. Let strumming dynamics through.
- Piano: NONE or very very light. Piano dynamics are the performance.
- Bass: light 2:1 if needed. Should be naturally even.
- NEVER hard-compress in acoustic music — you'll destroy the intimacy

STEREO FIELD:
- Vocal: dead center
- Acoustic guitar: center or very slight off-center
- Piano: natural stereo image (if stereo miced)
- Strings: slightly off-center opposite to guitar
- KEEP IT SIMPLE — this isn't a production mix, it's a live performance

ACOUSTIC-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- NOISE FLOOR: In quiet moments, the room and system noise become audible.
  Make sure gain staging is clean. Don't over-amplify quiet passages.
- FEEDBACK SENSITIVITY: Acoustic instruments and open vocal mics are
  feedback-prone at high gain. Watch the monitors. If feedback starts
  to ring, cut the frequency immediately — don't try to outrun it.
- DYNAMICS ARE THE PERFORMANCE: The artist controls their own dynamics
  by playing softer or louder. Your compression should catch only the
  extreme peaks, not flatten the dynamic range.
- MICROPHONE TECHNIQUE: The singer may move closer/further from the mic
  throughout the performance. Gentle compression helps, but don't fight
  proximity effect — a light HPF does more good.
- BETWEEN-SONG MOMENTS: The audience may be very quiet between songs.
  Make sure there's no buzz, hum, or noise from open channels. Mute
  unused inputs during silence.
- RESPECT THE SPACE: If the room has good acoustics, let them contribute.
  A little natural reverb is better than adding artificial reverb.
